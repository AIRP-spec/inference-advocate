# Architecture

This document keeps the code and the paper in register with each other. Every module in the
repository states the paper section and step it implements at the top of its file; this is the
index of those statements, plus an honest list of what the reference implementation does not
do.

The paper is *Accountable Inference Reputation Protocol (AIRP): An Advocate for AI Users and a
Surface for Policy Implementation* (Justin Philip Flores, 2026). Section 4 follows a single
response through fourteen steps. That path is the spine of this repository. The public demo is
at `https://tryairp.com`.

## Shape of the repository

```
packages/core          provider-agnostic library, no UI dependencies, no network beyond providers
packages/store-sqlite  SQLite StoreBackend adapter (Node). The only shipped persistence implementation
packages/evaluator-local  on-device GGUF semantic evaluator (node-llama-cpp). Hosts inject it; core does not import it
packages/daemon        local HTTP server on 127.0.0.1, and HostSession (HTTP + desktop loopback RPC)
packages/ui            React chat surface. Product chrome is ordinary chat; the monitor
                       (including a demo-only reputation reset), export view, scenario
                       register (live demo nests startup gaps under the steps), and
                       attributes sit in a bottom instrument drawer (demonstration only).
packages/desktop       Tauri shell (HostSession in the Node launcher over loopback RPC, no HTTP for the core API)
packages/demo          mock providers and the scripted end-to-end scenario
data/                  taxonomy, policy, jurisdictions, register, standing: documents, not code.
                       The held-out evaluator gate lives under data/evaluator-gate/
tools/                 demo key minting, additive public-entry re-sign, key set digests,
                       substituted-keys register fixture, evaluator-training recipe
deploy/                idempotent Apache/TLS/PM2 setup for the public AIRP domains
```

Three deliberate boundaries.

The core has no UI dependency and no framework. It is a library that could be driven by a CLI,
a desktop shell, or a phone. Persistence is a capability the host injects through
`StoreBackend` (`packages/core/src/store/port.ts`). The SQLite adapter lives in
`packages/store-sqlite` and is the only shipped implementation. The daemon exists because
filesystem paths and a browser tab do not meet; it constructs the SQLite adapter and calls
into core. Desktop packaging constructs the same `HostSession` (`packages/daemon/src/host.ts`)
in-process in the Node launcher and reaches it from Tauri over loopback RPC
(`packages/daemon/src/host-rpc.ts`), with Tauri commands as the UI bridge. There is no Node
stdio IPC child. The browser-tab path still uses the loopback HTTP listener. HostSession is
still not inside the Rust binary; embedding it there needs an in-process JS runtime or a Rust
port of the host and store. `AIRP_DESKTOP=1` makes the advocate say so at startup.

The trust artifacts are data files with detached signatures and pinned public keys, not
hardcoded constants. The Serving Register, the Standing document, the flag taxonomy, the
Delivery Policy and the jurisdiction rulesets are all loaded, all versioned, and all
replaceable. That is what makes the swap from local file to signed HTTPS fetch a transport
change rather than a redesign.

The key scopes are real. A component is handed the store keys its function requires and no
others, which is checked at construction. The telemetry emitter is the case that matters, and
it is discussed below.

## The fourteen steps, and where each one lives

| Step | Paper | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before | attestation package assembled at setup, Section 4 and Section 6 | `core/src/setup.ts`, `AttestationPackage` in `core/src/types.ts` |
| 1 | the prompt | `ui/src/App.tsx`, `core/src/advocate.ts` (`ask`), desktop: `packages/desktop` |
| 2 | attach the attestations, jurisdiction already loaded | `core/src/interchange/openai-adapter.ts`, `core/src/policy/jurisdiction.ts` |
| 3 | the request goes out over the Interchange | `core/src/interchange/wire.ts`, `openai-adapter.ts` |
| 4 | the provider serves from a registered endpoint | `demo/src/mock-provider.ts` (the provider half, for the demo) |
| 5 | the provider seals | `core/src/crypto/seal.ts` (`signSeal`) |
| 6 | the sealed response returns | `core/src/interchange/openai-adapter.ts` |
| 7 | deterministic layer | `core/src/monitor/deterministic.ts`, `core/src/monitor/register.ts`, `core/src/crypto/seal.ts` |
| 8 | semantic layer | `core/src/monitor/semantic.ts`, `core/src/monitor/taxonomy.ts`, `core/src/monitor/evaluators/`, `evaluator-local` |
| 9 | the ledger | `core/src/store/ledger.ts`, `core/src/store/port.ts`, adapter: `store-sqlite` |
| 10 | the score | `core/src/policy/score.ts`, `core/src/policy/config.ts` |
| 11 | the resolution | `core/src/policy/delivery.ts`, `core/src/policy/jurisdiction.ts` |
| 12 | delivery, with pinned notices | `core/src/policy/notices.ts`, `ui/src/App.tsx`, `ui/src/ExchangeTrail.tsx`, host: `daemon/src/host.ts` |
| 13, 14 | telemetry as rates, standing consumed back into step 10 | `core/src/telemetry/rates.ts`, `emitter.ts`, `standing.ts`, `export.ts` |

The provisional patent application's four mechanisms map on top of the same files:

| Mechanism | Provisional | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Deferred-delivery gate with rolling-window accumulation | Sections 1.1 to 1.9 | `core/src/policy/score.ts`, `delivery.ts`, `core/src/store/ledger.ts` |
| 2. Local-custody split with portable corpus | Sections 2.1 to 2.8 | `core/src/crypto/keys.ts`, `core/src/store/`, `store-sqlite` |
| 3. Independent monitor with integrity attestation | Sections 3.1 to 3.8 | `core/src/monitor/` |
| 4. Statistical enforcement engine | Sections 4.1 to 4.8 | `core/src/telemetry/` |

## Decisions worth stating

**The Interchange bootstraps on the OpenAI-compatible wire format.** A wire standard nobody
serves is not an existence proof. The advocate speaks the format every provider already speaks
and carries the AIRP additions in headers an unmodified server ignores: `AIRP-Exchange-Id` and
`X-AIRP-Attestations` outbound, `AIRP-Seal` inbound. A provider that has never heard of AIRP still
answers, and its
responses arrive unsealed, which is a finding rather than an error. That is the migration path.

**Deferral is fully blocking, and the transport is a separate question from the gate.** Nothing
reaches the user before evaluation completes. The provisional discloses pipelined evaluation
against a stream as an alternative embodiment. A reference implementation should demonstrate the
primary claim, not the optimization, and a response that has already been rendered cannot be
withheld. What changed is the transport: the client requests `stream: true` by default, reads
the event stream as it arrives, and accumulates under the binding the register entry names
(`core/src/monitor/content-bindings.ts`), while delivery stays blocked until step 12. The only
thing that leaves the accumulator during a stream is a decaying arrival scalar
(`core/src/interchange/arrival.ts`) with no content, no count and no offset in it.

**Both transport modes are permanent and neither is a fallback.** `TransportMode` is
`streamed` or `non_streamed`, selected per exchange, and the response content-type decides
which path actually runs, so a provider that ignores the flag still works. Streamed transport
buys an arrival indicator and costs a window in which accumulated content sits in the client
process while the gate holds it. Non-streamed closes that window, because plaintext does not
exist on the device until the whole response has arrived, and costs the indicator. Where the
user sets their own delivery policy there is nothing to defend against and streamed is better;
where the party subject to the policy is not the party who set it, non-streamed is stronger.
The client also declines to request a stream where the selected register entry names a binding
it does not hold, or names none while sealing, because §3.8.3 requires the member of providers
serving streamed responses and substituting a different extraction would change the octets a
seal covers. `deploy/verify-public-stream.mjs` proves the streamed path through Apache.

**The wait is a design problem, not a user education problem.** A delivery gate experienced only
as slowness reads as a defect, and defects get disabled, so `ui/src/ExchangeTrail.tsx` shows an
accreting status trail (send through deliver) bound to the real gate stages, with a shared motion
swatch driven by the arrival scalar while content is streaming, a wandering dot when transport is
held, and an escapement while checks run. Settled stages shrink to dots; a halt stays expanded on
the stopped mark. The composer uses the same bubble vocabulary in reverse, driven by composing
activity (key rate today), so outbound and inbound motion teach the same idea. Presentation is
out of scope per §1.1, so those files carry the argument and state plainly that these are the
reference implementation's choices rather than requirements. No minimum duration is imposed,
because padding the wait so the animation gets seen would make diligence feel slower than
negligence. The stage names come from `ExchangeStage` in the core; the trail compresses them into
six marks without inventing work the pipeline did not do.

**Shell appearance is light or warm dark.** The client shell tokens live under `:root` and
`[data-theme="dark"]` in `ui/src/styles.css`. Dark is deliberately not near-black: nearly
neutral gray with a whisper of warmth (hue ~55, chroma ~0.004), so it does not read brown or
olive. Preference is System / Light / Dark under Settings, stored in `localStorage` as
`airp-theme`, and applied before first paint. The instrument drawer stays its own cool dark
panel and does not flip with the shell.

**The hold is a conformance property, not a cryptographic one.** Response text is not in the
document before release: not blurred, clipped or faded, absent, because the only thing the
progress channel can carry is a stage name and a scalar (`daemon/src/progress.ts`). That is worth
claiming and it is narrower than it sounds. Plaintext has to exist on the device for evaluation to
happen at all, so where the party subject to the policy also controls the device, the gate is
advisory and real enforcement belongs to platform controls or to moving the boundary off the
device. The non-streamed mode narrows the window; it does not remove the requirement to trust the
client. The "Withhold Unverified Content" setting is where that trade is made, and where the
Delivery Policy can lock it, the control renders disabled with a line naming who set it rather
than disappearing.

**Evidence spans live in the transcript store, not the ledger.** This falls out of the paper
rather than being invented for the code. Section 5 says telemetry carries no evidence spans,
and the reason the emitter cannot transmit content is that it holds the ledger key and not the
transcript key. So an evidence span, which is conversation content, has to be under the
transcript key. The ledger row carries a type, a severity, and an opaque reference. There is a
test that reads the raw SQLite rows and asserts the words are not in them.

**The default semantic evaluator is a rule evaluator, not a model.** The paper's preferred
evaluator is a commons-maintained reference evaluation model, defined by three properties:
reproducible verdicts, inspectable basis, and provenance independent of any audited provider.
No certified commons model exists. The shipped rule evaluator satisfies all three properties
completely and has no judgment at all, which is the opposite failure from the one a hosted
frontier model would have. A demo that quietly used a frontier model to police frontier models
would be arguing against its own paper.

The evaluator is chosen by configuration rather than by code: an evaluator config file, or the
`AIRP_EVALUATOR_CONFIG` environment variable, selects among the rule evaluator, an on-device
local model, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `packages/core/src/monitor/evaluator-config.ts`
is where the costs of that choice are made visible rather than buried. A hosted evaluator
receives response content, so its origin appears in the export view as an outbound content
path and the advocate names it at startup; an evaluator on the loopback interface, or an
in-process local model, does not, because nothing left. And an evaluator served from the
same origin as a provider under evaluation is reported as the self-audit conflict of the
provisional's Section 3.4. The origin check catches the obvious case and cannot catch the
subtle ones, which the code says in its own comments.

### Evaluator tiers (provisional Section 3.4)

Three implementations occupy the hierarchy the provisional names.

**Rule.** Default when no config is present. Reproducible and inspectable, and it has no
judgment. It exists so the gate is observable end to end without a model file and without
content leaving the device.

**Local (`kind: "local"`, `@airp/evaluator-local`).** The preferred tier: a pinned small
language model running in-process through `node-llama-cpp`, so semantic evaluation has zero
outbound content paths and no external server. The evaluator id is `local-llm`. Its version
binds the model SHA-256 (first 12 hex characters) and the prompt template version, and
nothing else. Construction refuses to load if the GGUF file does not match the configured
digest. Temperature 0 and a fixed seed give stable verdicts on a given build and machine.
Bit-identical verdicts across differing hardware are not promised.

The held-out suite under `data/evaluator-gate/` is the acceptance gate for a trained
pin. It is a versioned document, not constants in TypeScript. The original 22 smoke
identities (`v0-positive-*`, `v0-counter-*`) live inside it and remain the live-pin
check under template v2.1. Human review of the suite is accepted on record. The live
pin is Qwen's published Qwen3-0.6B GGUF at Q8_0. Template v2.1 asks one
grammar-constrained yes or no per taxonomy class, with a shared prefix reused on one
sequence. v2 cleared the attractor false negatives. v2.1 confirmed that thinking was
already off in v2, constrained the verdict to `yes`/`no`, and did not hit the 4 to 10
second mean on this droplet (mean 42712ms). It also worsened counter-example
over-firing (11 of 11 counters fail). The report is
`packages/evaluator-local/FIXTURE-REPORT.md`. The zero-shot 0.6B is not a
judge in any decode configuration. A later LoRA of the same 0.6B hit a
capacity ceiling on the held-out gate across six gated checkpoints (no
per-class pass). The training base is now Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B
(`trainBaseRepoId`): same Qwen family, tokenizer, and chat template, only
the parameter count moves. The live pin remains the vendor Qwen3-0.6B GGUF at
template v2.1.

Template v3 (one compact yes/no line in taxonomy order, grammar-constrained, roughly
twenty tokens) is defined in `packages/evaluator-local/src/prompt-v3.ts` and is the
training target. The live path still uses v2.1. The training recipe lives under
`tools/evaluator-training/` (not a runtime package). The corpus has to be generated
from that recipe against a pinned writer model, leak-checked against the held-out
suite, and sampled for review before any LoRA run. The LoRA script, GGUF convert,
and held-out gate harness are in that directory. A checkpoint-sweep recipe
samples the training curve on Qwen3-1.7B and the same held-out gate; it
is a diagnostic, not a second publication criterion and not live v3. The
trained GGUF is not in this
build. The rule evaluator remains the default until a trained pin passes the held-out
gate. Do not weaken the items to match the zero-shot model.

This is one member of what the protocol expects to become a small certified evaluator family.
At reference stage there is no population and no pooled rate. Diversity across that family is
an ecosystem design problem and is not solved by shipping a ladder of sizes here.

**Hosted (`kind: "model"`).** An OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Where a device cannot run the
model, a hosted evaluator runs the same pinned reference model as the local tier, never a
larger one. Hosting changes where the judge runs, not who the judge is. Evaluator variation
happens only deliberately, as a distinct version-attributed member of the certified family,
never as a side effect of deployment. A hosted endpoint that is not loopback is an outbound
content path, and the advocate says so.

The native runtime lives in `@airp/evaluator-local`. Core never imports it. Hosts inject a
factory through `resolveEvaluator`, the same port pattern as `StoreBackend`. If config kind is
`local` and no factory was injected, core throws naming that obligation.

The GGUF itself is not in git. `npm run fetch:evaluator-model` downloads the pin recorded in
`data/models/manifest.json` and verifies SHA-256 before installing.

**`npm run doctor` prints the configuration that actually resolved.** It exists because of a
real failure: someone set an evaluator config, ran the demo, and could not tell from the output
whether it had taken effect. Configuration that silently does nothing is worse than
configuration that fails loudly, so there is now one command that answers what this advocate is
going to do with the files and environment variables it can see. It names the storage adapter
that resolved. It sends no requests to anyone.

## Persistence port

`StoreBackend` in `packages/core/src/store/port.ts` is the seam between decisions and storage.
Core keeps the ledger's canonical serialization and hash chaining, sequence assignment,
`verifyChain`, key-scope guards, evidence-under-transcript, and carryover and block semantics.
The host supplies opening, closing, migrating, and row-level reads and writes.
`@airp/store-sqlite` is the shipped adapter: schema, WAL, pragmas, and path handling.
`runStoreConformance` in core is the behavioral suite a second adapter must pass.

Ledger hashing uses a small pure-TypeScript SHA-256 in core so `hashEntry` stays synchronous
and free of `node:crypto`. Ed25519 seal sign/verify uses the same tradeoff: vendored
`@noble/ed25519` plus a pure-TypeScript SHA-512 in core, so `signSeal` / `verifySeal` stay
synchronous and portable. Store custody crypto in `crypto/keys.ts` (scrypt, HKDF-SHA256,
AES-256-GCM) uses vendored `@noble/hashes` and `@noble/ciphers` subsets for the same reason:
`MasterSecret` / `StoreKey` stay synchronous and free of `node:crypto`. Random seeds, master
secrets, salts, and IVs use `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues` (Web Crypto), not
`node:crypto`. Web Crypto has no scrypt, so a SubtleCrypto-only path would still need a
pure-TS KDF and would force async seal/open.

**Carryover lowers thresholds rather than multiplying severities.** The provisional discloses
both. A number the user can watch move is easier to argue with than a multiplier buried in a
sum.

**The register's pinned key is not the key inside the register.** The registrar public key
ships as a separate pinned file. Verifying a document with a key the document supplies is not
verification.

## What this build does not have

These are gaps, not omissions of convenience, and the advocate reports several of them about
itself at startup. Listing them here is the point of the section.

**Attribute attestation.** The attestation package is a locally asserted object. There is no
issuer, no selective disclosure, and no wallet. The paper's position is adopt-not-build, and
the EUDI and mDL rails are still arriving. Design the slot, do not implement it. The slot is
`AttestationPackage`, it crosses the wire, and it holds attributes rather than an identity,
which is the property that has to survive when a real issuer is wired in. The reference UI
exposes a Child mode toggle that flips `isAdult` and persists it under the preference store.
That is a demonstration of the attribute path, not verification. The banner says so. Pending
`minorOnly` jurisdiction provisions still do not tighten thresholds when Child mode is on;
what does change immediately is that self-release of a withheld response is refused.

**Demo reputation reset.** After a block, carryover and the rolling window normally decay only
through clean responses. The instrument drawer's Monitor tab exposes a reference-only control
that clears a provider's ledger accumulation and carryover so a demo can continue without five
paid clean exchanges. It does not release withheld content and it is not a product path. The
paper's recovery mechanism remains decay (Provisional Section 1.8).

**Hardware-backed keys, recovery, and the wallet.** `MasterSecret.fromPassphrase` is real
scrypt and the per-store derivation is real HKDF, but the demo and the daemon use a development
keyfile that sits on the same disk as the store. That is not custody, it is a note taped to the
safe, and the advocate says so at startup. Secure-element storage, the recovery spectrum
(recovery code, social shares, custodial and organizational escrow), and the non-exportable
attestation wallet keys are all disclosed in the provisional and none are built.

**External anchoring of the ledger chain.** The hash chain detects local rewriting, and there
is a test for that. It does not detect deletion of the whole store, which is why the provisional
pairs it with a periodic content-free commitment to a location outside the user's unilateral
control. Not built. The Standing floor is the complementary defense and is built.

**Multi-device sync, portability export, and custodial configuration.** Mechanism 2 describes a
versioned interchange format over the corpus, end-to-end encrypted sync, and custodial and
organizational configurations with key-scoped authority. The release-authority classes exist and
are enforced; the configurations that would grant a supervising party its key scope do not. The
`release(..., 'custodian')` path is therefore a demonstration of the authority mapping, not of a
real custodial grant.

**Monitor integrity attestation and the population cross-check.** Reproducible signed builds,
runtime attestation, verdict signatures chaining to an attested build, and the statistical
cross-check of each monitor against the population of monitors observing the same provider are
Mechanism 3 and are not built. Verdicts do carry binding version attribution, which is the piece
the rest hangs from. The on-device evaluator occupies the preferred deployment tier with a
pinned small model; it is not a certified commons evaluator, a divergent verdict on the
same pin is not yet cross-checked against a population, and the smoke identities still fail
(11 of 22 under template v2.1, all counter-example false positives). Mean evaluation wall
time on the reference droplet is still tens of seconds per response. The expanded held-out
gate at `data/evaluator-gate/` is the certification set for a trained pin. Human
review of that suite is accepted. The v3 serialization and the training recipe
(`tools/evaluator-training/`) are in the tree. The generated corpus, the LoRA, the
published GGUF, and template v3 on the live path are not. Training scripts
(LoRA, GGUF convert, held-out gate harness) live under `tools/evaluator-training/`.
A checkpoint sweep of the training curve is diagnostic only: it does
not change labels, the corpus, or the gate, and it does not put v3 on the
live path. The sweep report is not a second gate. The 0.6B sweep is a
measured capacity ceiling. The training base is Qwen3-1.7B; the live pin
is still Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0 at v2.1. `gate-from-adapters.py` gates saved
LoRA folders one at a time and deletes the merged weights and GGUF after
each checkpoint so disk does not accumulate. It does not train.
A v3 evaluate path exists on `LocalEvaluator` for that harness only;
`createLocalEvaluator` still constructs v2.1. The v3 path records empty
evidence: the trained task is the compact verdict line. The rule evaluator remains
the default until a trained pin passes the gate.

**The admission gate for telemetry.** Certification, hardware-attested instance uniqueness,
issuance rate limiting, coordination detection, and contribution caps are the four layers that
make a rate mechanism resistant to farming. None are built. The instance credential is a UUID.
The batch format is defined, and the granularity floor and the traffic-class denominator are
implemented, because those two are properties of computing the rate honestly rather than of
defending it.

**Compose activity is key-driven only.** The outbound sight glass varies with keystroke and
paste rate. There is no microphone or speech-to-text path feeding the same scalar yet, so
voice composition does not move the bubbles. The decay engine is shared in spirit with arrival
activity so that wiring can land later without changing the visual contract.

**Pre-seals.** draft-flores-airp-provenance §3.6 defines a pre-seal payload alongside the
terminal one, and `canonicalAirpPresealPayload` builds it byte for byte, ending after
`signed-at` with no content. Nothing in this build signs or verifies one. The SSE parser
recognizes an `airp-preseal` event and skips it, and the deterministic pass has no rule
comparing a pre-seal to the terminal seal that follows it. The builder is here so that the
payload the spec defines exists in one place and is under test, not because the mechanism is
wired up.

**Progress frames on the desktop RPC bridge.** The browser-tab path gets stage and arrival frames
because `daemon/src/server.ts` can stream an NDJSON response. The desktop shell reaches
`HostSession` over the loopback RPC bridge in `daemon/src/host-rpc.ts`, which answers requests and
does not carry notifications, so the status trail there has no arrival signal to drive the
bubble field and uses the wandering-dot wait presentation instead. That is a gap in the bridge.
The alternative would have been a timer-driven animation that reads as arrival, which is a small
lie in the one product where that is expensive.

**Calibrated typical durations.** The preference store still keeps the median of this client's
own last twenty exchanges with that provider and model (nothing until there are three). The
status trail no longer quotes that median as a wait estimate: the design forbids implying a time
the client does not have for the response in flight. The figure remains available to other
surfaces that need a historical typical, not a prediction.

**DNS deployment.** draft-flores-airp-provenance §4.7 puts entry selection on `_airp` TXT
records beneath the provider identity domain, with a key set digest (`k`) confirming the
selected entry. The reference client parses those records, refuses unsafe `r` auto-fetch
targets, and computes the key set digest. Public demo DNS and Apache publish
`honestmodel.win` / `cheapai.win` bindings and serve the register at the `r=` URL
(`deploy/`), including a detached `.sig` alongside the document. `npm run key-set-digest`
prints the ready-to-paste TXT lines (including `k`) from the deployed register. The client
still loads a local signed register file rather than fetching `r` over HTTPS with `maxAge`
caching. Entries without `identityDomain` (the `demo.*` fixtures behind `tryairp.com`) stay
unconfirmed by DNS. A negative fixture at
`data/register/serving-register.substituted-keys.json` (also served under
`/airp/register.substituted-keys.json`) carries a valid registrar signature with substituted
keys on `honestmodel.win.entry`; load it via `AIRP_REGISTER_DOCUMENT` to demo refusal on
`key_set_digest_mismatch` rather than signature failure.

**Real thresholds.** Every number in `data/policy/delivery-policy.json` is demonstration scale
and labeled as such in three places. Calibration is an open question in the paper and it stays
open here.

**Taxonomy v0.3.0 keeps the paper's four named flags and adds a reference harm set.** Persona
claims, relational hooks, sycophancy, and simulation obscured remain. The reference additions are
profanity, self-harm (encouragement and methods, not crisis referral), sexual content, child
sexual exploitation, graphic violence, hate, and criminal assistance. Lists are English-centric
and short on purpose. This is not a moderation product. Child sexual exploitation is mandatory
non-delivery and non-releasable under the illustrative New York ruleset. Self-harm encouragement
is non-releasable there as well. Pending `minorOnly` provisions raise floors further for minors
when enacted.

**The jurisdiction rulesets are illustrative.** They were written by an engineer to prove the
slot changes an outcome. They are not legal advice and no lawyer has reviewed them. Each file
carries that disclaimer in its own `disclaimer` field, and the UI renders it above the policy.
Provisions may be marked `in_force` or `pending`. Only `in_force` rules change delivery.
Pending provisions (for example New York's unsigned S 9051 minor-protection block) appear in
startup warnings, doctor output, and the policy view, and do not tighten thresholds or refuse
responses. That is deliberate: listing a bill is not the same as applying it as law.

**Escalation.** Section 1.6 of the provisional discloses de-identified escalation for
designated severe categories. The `escalating` release-authority class exists in the type
system and nothing implements it. Whether to build it at all is an open design-ethics question
in the author's own notes, and building it quietly would have been the wrong way to answer it.

**Desktop HostSession still lives under Node.** The Tauri shell loads the built UI from disk
and calls `HostSession` through Tauri commands over loopback RPC into a HostSession the Node
launcher constructed in-process (`packages/daemon/src/host-rpc.ts`). There is no HTTP listener
for advocate operations in the desktop path, and no Node stdio IPC child. The browser-tab path
still uses the loopback daemon. HostSession is not embedded inside the Tauri binary;
`AIRP_DESKTOP=1` reports that gap at startup. Bundled installers (`bundle.active`) are off.
App icons under `packages/desktop/src-tauri/icons/` and the web favicon set under
`packages/ui/public/` use the Inference Advocate mark. Building the shell needs Rust and
Tauri 2 system libraries (webkit2gtk 4.1 on Linux). See `packages/desktop/README.md`.

## Working agreements

- Every module comments its paper section and step at the top.
- No em-dashes in any prose file in this repository.
- Commits are small and message-disciplined, so the history reads as a build narrative.
- Data before code: taxonomies, policies, and rulesets are versioned documents, not constants.
- Every claim the code makes about itself should have a test that would fail if it stopped
  being true. The ones that matter most are in `packages/core/test/telemetry.test.ts` and
  `packages/core/test/store.test.ts`.
- CI runs the typecheck, the test suite, the demo end to end, and the interface build on Node
  22 and 24. The demo is in CI on purpose: the repository's central claim is that one scripted
  scenario executes the paper's argument, and a claim like that should break the build when it
  stops being true.
